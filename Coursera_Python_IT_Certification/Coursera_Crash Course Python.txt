//Specialization intro
    -system administator
    -Cloud solutions
    -DevOps Specialist
    -site reliability engineer
    -data analyst

//The Beginning of Your Programming Journey
    -programming language, scripting, realte to intro

//What is Programming
    -semantics: actual meaning of statement/effect of the insturctions
    -Syntax: rules of statement
    knowing the syntax and semantic of a programming language
        allows us to tell the computer what we want it to do

//What is automation
    -automation is the process of replacing a manual step 
        with one that happens automatically

//What is Python
    -benefits:
        -similar to human language
        -easy to read and write
        -we can guess what the code does
    -semantic problem: if syntax is correct and than the script 
        has unexpected behavior or output

//Why python is relevant to it
    -python makes it easy to express the fundamental concepts of programming
    -python easy to understand and easy to maintain

//Hallo World
    -function are pieces of code that perform a unit of work
    -Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct insturctions

//Getting information from the user

//Python can be your Calculator

//First Step Wrap up

//Basic Python Syntax Introduction
    -Data types
        -String
    -Variables
        -are names that we give to certain values
    -Implicit conversion is where the interpreter hepls us out and automatically converts one data type into another
    -explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data to another data type by calling relevant function

//Defining function
    - a block of program that can be called many times by other insturction
    -parameters
    -returning values

//Principles of Code Reuse

//Comparison

//Loops
    -for, while, 
//
