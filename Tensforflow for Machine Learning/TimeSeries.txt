Time Series

******************************************************
//Multivariate TIme Series
    - in a grapsh and in a time there is a multi variable bvalue

//Machine Learning applied to time Series
    - 

//Common patterns in time Series
    - trend=a line
    - seasonality= have a multi peak
    - combination both trend and seasonality
    - random
    - lag
    - non stationary

//RNN
    - because it may recur the value for the next state

//Lambda layer
    -
