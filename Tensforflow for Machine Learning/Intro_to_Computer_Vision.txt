//An introduction to compter vision
    - Computer viison is the field of having computer understand and 
        label what is present in an image

//Using Callbacks to Control training

//What are convolutions and pooling
    - Classifying MNIST dataset with the simple DNN can gain high accuracy on training and low accuracy on test set
    - CNN will give us a context on the image instead of match the pixel value
    - pooling is a way to compresing the image
